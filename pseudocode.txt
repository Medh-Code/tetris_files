how to move the shape down without interfering with other game shapes:

while whatever is underneath the bottom most point of the shape is empty:

    set the value of each space the shape occupies == the space underneath it

call the generate shape fucntion again to start this function again with a new shape





MEANWHILE the user can press DOWN ARROW to move the shape down 1
use onkey instead of onkeypress to allow the user to hold while the shape 'falls'
